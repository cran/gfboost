\value{
A Boosting family object

\description{
{Gradient-free Gradient Boosting family for the hard ranking loss function including its fast computation.}
}
\details{
{The hard ranking loss is used to compare different orderings, usually the true ordering of instances of a data
set according to their responses with the predicted counterparts. The usage of the \code{pcaPP} package avoids the
cumbersome computation that would require \deqn{frac{n}{2(n-1)}} comparisons. \code{Rank} returns a family object
as in the package \code{mboost}.}

\examples{
{y<-c(-3, 10.3,-8, 12, 14,-0.5, 29,-1.1,-5.7, 119)
 yhat<-c(0.02, 0.6, 0.1, 0.47, 0.82, 0.04, 0.77, 0.09, 0.01, 0.79)
 Rank()@risk(y,yhat)}

Rank()@risk(x,z)}
{x<-1:6
